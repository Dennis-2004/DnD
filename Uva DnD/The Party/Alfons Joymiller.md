Alfons Joymiller, son of [[Lennard Joymiller,]] grew up knowing little else than the field he helped his father cultivate. Born an only son to a destitute farmer, he had his work cut out for him. From tending to cattle and crops to fertilizing the fields and culling overgrowth, he had little time to dedicate to his interests or education. His life passed him by until he was finally old enough to inherit his father's land and make a family of his own. He would have four children by the age of 31, and was fully fulfilled with his fate, to spend the rest of his life tending the farm and raising his kids to the best of his ability. 

One evening in autumn, he would notice that one of the pumpkins in the batch he had harvested that  morning had strange black dots all around its surface. The pumpkin looked meek and sickly, and smelled closely of death. There was a sticky green and gray puss leaking out from the sides of the vegetable. Alfons, in all his years, had never seen such a grotesque infection afflict a plant. After disposing of the pumpkin and checking to see if any others were infected, he moved on with his day although a nagging discomfort kept hold of him for weeks to come. 

Several months later, late at night, he would awaken to violent heaving and coughing coming from downstairs. He recognized the source immediately, his youngest daughter [[Maria Joymiller]].  He and his wife ran down in a hurry to her room.  Indeed she lay in her bed, skin pale as snow and with bloodshot eyes, writhing and ceaselessly coughing, so violently as if she were trying to cough her very lungs out. 

His wife looked at Alfons, with fear in her eyes. He quickly exclaimed, "try and relieve her, I will bring someone to help!"

When he returned with healer in tow, Maria was still in the same state as when he had left. 
The healer quickly went to work, and much to their relief the coughing subsided and the poor girl could finally rest. 
The healer explained that he had never seen an infection like this one, and that what he did was merely a treatment of the symptoms and not of the disease itself. 
Alfons asked tentatively if there was anything which could be done, the healer struggled to think of an answer for a while before replying in a grim tone; 
"I will try what I can" 

Maria would succumb to the illness just 4 days later. 

The day before her death, Alfons, while bringing her some water, noticed a black mark on her left cheek, out of which was leaking a green and gray puss. The smell too reminded him clearly of what he had seen months ago. 

Just 3 days after having burried Maria with his own hands,  both of his sons would experience the same symptoms. The healer refused to come to the house anymore, recognizing the disease as easily contractible his last words to a desperate Alfons were  "You're mad if you think I'm ever stepping foot near you or your family again!" 

Day by day the brothers would grow weaker until they finally too succumbed.

Then one day he awoke to more coughing, this time coming from his bedside. 
It was his wife's turn. 

No longer able to restrain himself, he went out to the village center to plead the healer once more for help. 

The usually bustling town square with its markets and stores and carriages carrying goods was devoid of all life. 
Soft wailing and coughing could be heard from inside the homes of some villagers, but most were dead quiet. 
He knocked on the front door of the healer's house near 20 minutes, there was no response. Most likely he had died to the disease as well. 
By some cruel twist of fate, he would be the last to contract the disease, just a day after having buried his wife and last child. 
He lay in his bed waiting for the infection to take him, hoping to be reunited with his family in the afterlife. 

The virus was ruthless. His lungs and airways felt as if on fire from the incessant coughing. Rarely could he rest, the infection let off only about twice a day and for extremely short intervals. 
However, Alfons payed it no mind. 
He knew it would be over in just a couple days time, and that he would meet his wife and children soon. 
ever moving again seemed untannable. 
Despite his deep yearning for death, the day would not come.
It was anything but a miracle. 
Though the infection stubbornly refused to take his life, Alfons felt on the brink of death at every moment. A perpetual hell that had no escape.
