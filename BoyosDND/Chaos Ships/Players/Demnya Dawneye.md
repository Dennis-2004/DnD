The general story being that my character killed a bad person, who was threatening her little sister. And had enough brain power to frame the local "evil" noble, who everybody know committed crimes, but always got away with it.
A bit after he got imprisoned she and her sister left town. (As fast as possible while also taking into account that she had to wait long enough to not have her leaving and the murder connected)

She doesn't know if the noble found out about who actually did the murder. And she travelled far away from there. But she considers herself a criminal now.

She sends enough money back to her little sister, [[Izraza Dawneye]]

Bounty: 150
