Welcome to the wondrous world of Navarre, shattered into countless fragments by an ancient cataclysm, and separated by vast, treacherous oceans, each teeming with ferocious sea monsters and cursed spirits. A rich tapestry of hundreds of islands, each imbued with its own unique culture, magic, and lore.

Yet amidst this splendor and wonder, a battle between chaos and order is being fought. The consequences of which can effect the entire world of Navarre. This ancient battle is being fought between the pirates who fight for freedom, greed or just cause why not and the Marine Corps who seek to rule over the world and maintain order and law.
