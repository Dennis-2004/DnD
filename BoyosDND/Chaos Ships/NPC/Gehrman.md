### Gunsmith
Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Tinker’s Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are only available through crafting.

### Firearm Properties
Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of [Weapon Properties](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:gunslinger:firearm-properties). Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property. These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.

### Adept Marksman
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to perform powerful [Trick Shots](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:gunslinger:trick-shots) to disable or damage your opponents using your firearms.

**_Trick Shots._** You learn two [trick shots](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter:gunslinger:trick-shots) of your choice. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. Each use of a trick shot must be declared before the attack roll is made. You can use only one trick shot per attack. You learn an additional trick shot of your choice at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each time you learn a new trick shot, you can also replace one trick shot you know with a different one.

**_Grit._** You gain a number of grit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You regain 1 expended grit point each time you roll a 20 on the d20 roll for an attack with a firearm, or deal a killing blow with a firearm to a creature of significant threat (DM’s discretion). You regain all expended grit points after a short or long rest.

**_Saving Throws._** Some of your trick shots require your targets to make a saving throw to resist the trick shot’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Trick shot save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

### Deadeye Shot
When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to gain advantage on the attack roll.

### Violent Shot
When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one or more grit points to enhance the volatility of the attack. For each grit point expended, the attack gains a +2 to the firearm’s misfire score. If the attack hits, you can roll one additional weapon damage die per grit point spent when determining the damage.
