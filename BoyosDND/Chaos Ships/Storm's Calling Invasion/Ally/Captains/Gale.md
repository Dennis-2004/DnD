### Weapon Bond
At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.

### War Magic
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Eldritch Strike
At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature's resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.

### Arcane Charge
At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or after the additional action.

### Legendary Action

#### Lighting Step

You bound off the ground at such speed that you break through the light barrier, leaving every molecule you pass bursting with energy.  To the mortal eye you become a bolt of lighting and reappear 100 feet from where you were.

You can spend a legendary action to seemingly teleport to a location within 100 feet of you, moving in a straight line. Anything you are wearing or carrying moves with you.  You create a line of lightning between where you traveled from and to. This line is 5 feet wide and each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw (vs your spellcasting DC). A creature who fails this save takes (½ of your dexterity score)d8 lightning damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- Increase your dexterity score by 2.  Every point spent on this ability increases your Dex by an additional 2 points, while in your Super Charged state. (3/3)
- Increase your melee reach by 15ft for every point in this boon. (1/3)
- Increase your Dexterity Score by 2 (2/3)
