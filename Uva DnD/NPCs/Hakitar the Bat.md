Hikatar is a druid of the [[Druidic Circle of Nature#Mountain]] sect. He is a wood elf of 803, he floats through caves and catches mice like no other. He was once advised by Boron to do less spend time like a bat. He ignored this advice, making his face
more like that of a bat. His fangs are larger than normal, and his chin has gotten a lot smaller. Because Hikatar most floating in the caves of his life, Olaf has little to no contact with him. He protects the nocturnal animals.
